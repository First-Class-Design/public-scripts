# Public Scripts
Public scripts and code assets to be used via jsDelivr on all projects. This repo is designed to house them all as long they are global and updates will not break support.

### Notes
- Read timer only works with 1 instance of  `.page_rt` and will require code mods to work with multiple instance (i.e. WF conditional show / hide). WordPress is unaffected due to how PHP removes the HTML altogether.
